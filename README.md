The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for and view current weather information for different cities. The application provides an
interactive interface where users can enter a city name to retrieve weather data, including temperature, weather conditions, and more.

City Search: Users can enter the name of a city to get the latest weather information. The search is handled through a user-friendly input form.

Current Weather Display: The application retrieves and displays various weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions.

API Integration: The app interacts with a third-party weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time weather data based on user input.

Responsive Design: The dashboard is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technical Stack
Front End: Built using React, which provides a dynamic and responsive user interface. The components include:

Search: For entering city names.
Weather: To display the fetched weather data.
Back End: Implemented with Node.js and Express, serving as an intermediary between the front end and the weather API.

The back end handles requests for weather data and forwards them to the weather API.
State Management: Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect hooks are used to manage the application state and side effects, such as fetching weather data when the user submits a city name.

Application Workflow
User Interaction: The user types a city name into the search form and submits it.
Fetching Weather Data: The front end makes a request to the back end, which then calls the weather API to retrieve the relevant weather information.
Displaying Results: The retrieved weather data is sent back to the front end and displayed to the user, showing current weather conditions and details.

The Weather Dashboard project serves as an excellent introduction to full-stack development concepts, including API integration, state management in React, and setting up a simple server with Node.js 
and Express. It demonstrates how to build interactive applications that provide real-time data to users, making it a practical and educational experience for developers. Further enhancements could include 
features like storing favorite cities, adding forecasts, or incorporating a user authentication system.
